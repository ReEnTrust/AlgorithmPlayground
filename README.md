# ReEnTrust-Mediation

This git repository contains a system that enables an end-user to:
- get hotel recommendations from different profile settings
- manipulate the input of an algorithm by choosing different presets
- discuss and personalise the selected algorithm by going through a mediation process


## Sandbox

The sandbox shows different hotel recommendations with respect to profiles, algorithm presets and the database used for training.

The recommender algorithm used in this sandbox is a simple hybrid recommender system (see https://pypi.org/project/hybrid-recommender/). 

### Data used
